# Probability Course examples

This repository contains code examples for the problems and demos in the introduction to probability course at the EUI.

The course follows Blitzstein and Hwang (2019).

The example jupyter notebooks also introduce some useful python skills, like symbolic math.

So far the examples are:

- The Birthday problem simulation: how does the probability of a birthday match in a room of k people change as k increases, two ways: naive definition of probability and Poisson approximation.
- The Logistic distribution: how to calculate probabilities by coding the pdf and cdf of a logistic random variable, with extra code for plotting.
- Universality of the uniform: how to draw from a logistic distribution by using a uniform random number generator, showing how the histogram of draws approximates a logistic pdf.
- Magic of the Normal: a notebook to plot a 3D bivariate normal pdf, showing how to obtain the marginal and conditional distributions + how the sums of 2 normal random variables is also normally distributed
- Markov chain example: an example of a Markov chain that representes the process of finding and losing jobs of a worker. Shows how to calculate the stationary distribution in 3 different ways, simulates the chain to show convergence in time spent and uses the simulations to illustrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.
